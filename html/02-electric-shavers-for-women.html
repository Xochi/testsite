<p>Braun is a brand with an inherently masculine name. Which is kind of weird when you&#39;re thinking of buying a shaver for a female. Maybe think of it as the manly cousin with the soft and sensitive feminine side, ready to give a clean shave to the most delicate of epidermis. </p>
<p>Designed with soft skin in mind, the Braun comes with a unique exfoliation attachment that is designed to re-energize skin and give a glowing appearance. Thats some A-grade husband bait right there. There also a fancy bikin trimmer attachment (more husband bait) for avoiding awkward hairs on sunny summer days.   </p>

The great thing about this one is it also comes with a charging bay that will comfortably sit on your counter top. </p>
<p>If you have very coarse hair, this shaver is a great choice for you. Of course if you do have coarse hair, then you have much bigger problems than choosing a shaver.

<p>This one also comes with a bikin trimmer attachment so you got no worry snapping out that thong from the closet in the summer season.</p>

<p>##What area will you be using this on?</p>
<p>Our bodies have different convex and concave contours and depending on the woman, some body types will do better with different types of shavers. The contoured electric shaver with foil heads is quite popular in this category and the reason is that this shape is great for curved areas of the body like the underarms and in and around the legs.</p>
<p>Steel blade heads from trusted brands will also provide a better shave, this is important for pubic regions like the bikin line. Having a sharp cutting action around this area will mean less shaving rash in the long run so it is important to have a high quality device. Having a device with a pivoting head and multiple foils also means you will get a better shave the first time.</p>
<p>Accesories that come with the product also have to be considered. Things such as the bikini trimmer or a charging base can save you time in the long run and minimise the time you spend in the bathroom.</p>
<p>##Getting the right one for you</p>
<p>This was a great line up of products. It&#39;s definitely not an easy choice but if you know what skin type needs you are after then choosing the shaver with the right head and additional accessories shouldn&#39;t be too difficult. </p>
<p>Besides, choosing an electric shaver can be tough. But choosing a husband when you got limited options is even tougher. Work those odds in your favor by paying attention to your basic hygiene and you&#39;ll have the men lining up to put a ring on it as if you knew how to make a milkshake like Kelis. In the yard, of course.</p>
