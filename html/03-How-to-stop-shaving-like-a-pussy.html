<p>##And how to grow a pair of large cojones</p>
<p>For God&#39;s sake man! What in the world do you think you are doing? Please, stop. Step out of your body for one moment and just observe what you are doing. Can you see it? You&#39;re shaving like a God damn pussy. Who taught you that? Did you even have a Dad when you were growing up? </p>
<p>I didn&#39;t have a Dad around when I was young. I was a dapper boy with no guidance in the world. And yes, I shaved like a pussy. We have all done it at one stage or another and we shouldn&#39;t be ashamed to admit it, because it happens to the best of us. What you have to recognise is that through practice, perseverence and a realignment of attitude, change is possible. </p>
<p>Today, I am a rugged woodsman that wrestles crocodiles with one hand and shaves his neck with a <a href="">straight razor</a> with the other. I&#39;ve overcome my shaving issues and become the man that that young boy would be proud to call himself today.</p>
