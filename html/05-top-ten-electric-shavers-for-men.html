<p>#10 of the best electric razors for men</p>
<p>##And how to choose the right one</p>
<p>The best electric razor for your face is a decision that involves making an informed decision based on price, quality, features, your personal needs and brand awareness/trust. You know you are going to have a quality shave if you are choosing a well known brand such as Braun or Phillips but even these big names of the razor world have been known to produce some flops.</p>
<p>Whenever I am choosing an electric razor or suggesting one to a friend one of the highest traits of a product I look for is quality of build. Shavers get wet, are sometimes dropped, can be possibly stored in humid locations, factors like this make me think of selecting a razor with a reputation for sturdiness. </p>
<p>Braun, although not cheap, is such a brand. My take on it is would you rather pay a premium now and have a machine that will last you many years to come? Or you can go for the cheaper alternative and expect to be buying anew within a year or two.</p>
<p>##3 contour rotary heads vs straight foils head</p>
<p>Ah, the age old question every man has faced when purchasing an electric razor. </p>
<p><strong>Rotary shavers</strong> - Their most common format is the classic 3 blade head - 3 circular surfaces that contour and hug the face to give the closest shave possible. These razors are usually moved across the face in a circular pattern in order to pick up and cut the hairs on the face. These shavers are generally believed to have greater maneuverability and are able to get to hairs in harder to reach areas such as the underside of the chin and the neck. </p>
<p><strong>Straight Foil shavers</strong> - These are the types of machines that have been around since the first electric shavers were invented. They have a straight cylindrical head with many holes in it, underneat which the blade moves side to side. </p>
<p>This style of razors will give you an arguably closer shave when compared to the rotary model because the blade can sit closer to the face and is only separated by one piece of metal. The motion you use to shave with this type of blade is an up and down, left to right pattern. The problem with the design is that it is much harder to reach areas of skin on the neck where the rotary head has much less difficulty.</p>
