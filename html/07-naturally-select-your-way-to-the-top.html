<p>#How to &#39;Naturally Select&#39; your way to the top of false human hierarchies through proper beard maintenance.</p>
<p>##Identify and scale the true power structures of everyday life</p>
<p>The same way a lion measures its importance in a pride based on the length of his mane, a man can measure his worth by the girth of his beard. Strong, thick masses of hair project a power and social standing that not even the greatest of men can muster without the help of superficial material possessions. A Rolls Royce has no worth in the face of a power beard. The beard of Bin Laden launched athousand cruise missiles half way across the curvature of the earth. Such is the power of the beard. And such is the danger of not maintaining it with regular trimming.</p>
<p>Whether it be your pre pubescent teen, intently caressing his first facial follicles on his baby smooth cratered skin or your old weird uncle with the Russian Tsar Stalin moustache - facial hair maketh the man. You may be still trying to &#39;find yourself&#39;, or maybe you&#39;re that guy cruising through life with no real ideas or ambitions. All I can say is - Where&#39;s your beard game at?</p>
<p>The greatest and most difficult first step you can make in changing your life is to define yourself. As a human being. As a man.</p>
<p>If you want to define yourself you must start with the superficialities. Why, you ask? This doesn&#39;t make sense. If I want to define myself I should be discovering what really motivates me or maybe I should figure out what to do with my life. What a bunch of nancy boy bullshit. </p>
<p>Your every day habits are what define you. Do you wake up at 6 every day and do 30 push ups? If you do or know someone that does, what does this speak of their character? Are you a guy or gal that properly trims their beard on a regular and consistent basis? How do you think the world sees you? How would you see yourself if you were this type of person? Especially if you were female?</p>
<p>Let&#39;s not put this lightly or smooth it over with honey and dip it in chocolate. Let&#39;s make this clear - Life is not easy. First of all, it&#39;s not meant to be. Secondly, if you are anywhere over the age of 21 and sit within the bell curve of the average income, you probably already know it.</p>
