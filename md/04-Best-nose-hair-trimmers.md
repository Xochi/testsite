#The Best Nose Hair Trimmers money can buy
##How to stop looking __damn old__ and out of touch with society

It's a beautiful sunny day. The air is crisp and you have an extra spring in your step, life couldn't be better. You're walking down the street minding your own business and out of the corner of your eye you spot an attractive young lady selling subscriptions for sponsoring a child in poverty in some ghastly third world conditions. She introduces herself. You converse. You discuss the terrible plight of Syrian refugees and the unjust conditions they must endure. There's a connection and you can sense it. She has a glint in her eye that you didn't see her give to any of the other men she was talking to. You ask if she would like to catch a drink some time after work. She gleefully accepts and that extra spring you had all morning carries you along for the rest of the day. You're a smooth criminal you sexy mofo. And you know it.

Now, if we break down the many subtle interactions that occur during the mating rituals of the homo sapien, we would find many variables that placed the odds favourably in this gentleman's corner. Maybe his confidence was particularly strong that day, so strong in fact that he didn't resort to desparate tactics like 'negging' in order to win the young ladies affections. Or maybe the way he was carrying himself that day lent him an air of nonchalance and bravado that showed the world he was not ashamed of who he was. More importantly: What was he doing that very morning befor his brisk walk? I'll tell you why he had a spring in his step - He was eradicating unsightly nose hairs from his frontal facing orifices. Yes, those air holes we call nostrils.

One of my pet peeves as a gentleman that is both elegant, dapper and rugged like a beastly mountain bear in equal amounts - is bad grooming. Every day millions of men lay their heads to the ground like helpless bleeting lambs to the slaughter, succumbing to the ills of unsighlty nose hairs. Missed opportunities include: Making contact with attractive and willing females; Impressing Mr Boss man and getting that next promotion at work; Increasing positive workplace relations with females that have available attractive friends; Getting to skip the sandwich cue when the owner recognises the power of a well groomed individual that looks like they are too important to be waiting in line. All this and more is what we all needlessly sacrifice on a daily basis. A true tragedy in the eyes of any  man's eyes.

##Break out the nose hair machines
What can you do about it though? You can sit there painstakingly trimming away at your nostrils with some curved scissors you bought from the Chinese 2 dollar shop. Cutting skin and drawing blood in an epic dance of quivering hands and bruised noses, I strongly urge avoiding this option if possible.
